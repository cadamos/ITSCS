###### ITS Clock-in/out revamp

Revamp of ITS Clock-in/out page.  Goal of revamp is to place clear emphasis on current state and reduce/eliminate erroneous clocks.  Current users are erroneously clocking in-out and not correcting due to non-apparent state.

Goals of new design:

1. Establish text hierarchy
2. Heighten ease of UX
3. Better utilize JS + jQuery to dynamically emphasize state
4. Build easily sustainable and modifable layout to allow for rapid changes/additions/removal via *CSS Grid*
5. Enhance mobile experience to allow for remote clock-ins in edge cases.

Leveraging *CSS Grid* + *Flexbox* for layout due to lack of need for IE11 support.
